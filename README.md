# School-2016-2017 [OLD] [![Telegram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Telegram-@iDoppioclick-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://t.me/iDoppioclick)
Repository where I'll put files of general works of all subjects.

### General Infos
I will put the files divided in folders by the name of the subjects, containing a folder with the date of the works.
Inside these folders there will be the files and a small .txt file, where I'll put textually what we've done.

### Repo clonation
If (for some akward reasons) You want to clone the repo on your server, You just only have to do these commands:

    $ sudo apt-get install git
    $ git clone github.com/iDoppioclick/School-2016-2017.git
    $ cd School-2016-2017

To update the repository with the new files, just run this easy command.

    $ git pull
